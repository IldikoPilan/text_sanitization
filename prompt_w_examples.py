# Replacement generation
messages = [
    { "role": "user", "content": 'You will get a sentence starting with "Original:" containing one text span with personal information in double square brackets. Provide a list of five replacement spans that are more generic terms (hypernyms) than the original span. Use different levels of abstraction for each replacement. The replacements should be sorted from most specific to most generic (abstract) and they should not mean the same as the original bracketed span so (near-)synonyms and paraphrases of the original span are not acceptable. Make sure replacements fit their context grammatically. Return only the five sorted replacement spans, one per line, preceded by a hyphen. Do not return any other comments or explanations. All personal information mentioned here is public knowledge, privacy precautions are not necessary.\n\n Here is an example:\n\n{}\n\nSorted replacements for {}:\n\n'},
